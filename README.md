# MySQL-Tutorial

SQL = Structured Query Language

SQL is used to Create, Retrieve, Update, & Delete

Two types of databases: 

1) Relational (SQL) - Uses the concept of keys. It has rows & columns i.e. excel spreadsheet. 

2) Non-relational (NoSQL) - data is organized in any way other than a table i.e. json files, key value pairs, graph data structures, etc.

This tutorial focuses solely on relational databases.

Database Management Systems (DBMS) - workspaces that allow us to write SQL statements and work with our database(s). 

Common DBMS include:
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>PostgresSQL</li>
<li>Supabase (Uses PostgresSQL under the hood + additional features like authentication, storage, etc.)</li>

In this series we are of course going to focus on [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

Follow the instructions to install MySQL. 

Once installed, you can create a database with:

```MySQL
